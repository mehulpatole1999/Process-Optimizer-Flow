   - Monitor the flow's run history for any errors.
   - Troubleshoot issues by checking the detailed error messages and adjusting the flow accordingly.

5. Conclusion:
In this whitepaper, we've outlined the step-by-step process of designing a Power Automate flow for extracting zip files from a shared mailbox in Outlook, storing them in OneDrive, and converting them into XLSX files in another OneDrive folder.
